MAX('Life expectancy')
FROM worldlifeexpectancy
group by country
having MIN('Life expectancy') !=0
and MAX('Life expectancy')!= 0
order by country desc;

2. FInd the country that made the biggest strive  lowest to gratest.

SELECT country,
round(MAX('Life expectancy')-MIN('Life expectancy'),1) as LIfe_Increase_15years
FROM worldlifeexpectancy
group by country
having MIN('Life expectancy') !=0
and MAX('Life expectancy')!= 0
order by country asc;

3. FInd the life Expectancy for Each Year and round by 2, and order by the smallest to biggest

Select year,round(avg('Life expectancy'),2) as avg_life_expectancy
from  worldlifeexpectancy
where 'Life expectancy'!=0
group by year 
order by year;

4. compare  the average 'Life expectancy' to the GDP  by country

Select country,round(avg( 'Life expectancy'),1) as Avg_LIfe_Expectancy,
round(avg(gdp),1) as avg_gdp
from worldlifeexpectancy
group by country 
having Avg_LIfe_Expectancy>0
and avg_gdp>0
order by  avg_gdp asc;

select
sum(case  WHen GDP>=1500 THen 1 Else 0 end ) High_GDP_Count,
avg(Case when GDP>= 1500Then 'Life expectancy' ELse null end ) High_Gdp_count_Life expectancy
sum(case  WHen GDP<=1500 THen 1 Else 0 end ) High_GDP_Count,
avg(Case when GDP<= 1500Then 'Life expectancy' ELse null end ) low_Gdp_count_Life expectancy

6. what are the avg Life experctancy of each status
select status,Round(avg( 'Life expectancy'),1)
from  worldlifeexpectancy
group by status
order by status asc;

7. FInd how many country have developing and developed status
select status ,count( distinct country)
from  worldlifeexpectancy
group by Status;

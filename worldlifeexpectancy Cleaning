1. first I Look for any Duplicates  This example I concat it so it will be country for each year, so it will be easier to find.

Select country, year,concat(country,year),count(concat(country,year))
from worldlifeexpectancy
group by country, year,concat(country,year)
having count(concat(country,year)) ;

2. I USed a window Function to give a row number for  each row that has more than 1 duplicate and putting it on  a subquery to filter .

select *
from  (
Select  row_id,
row_number () over ( Partition by concat(country,year) order by concat(country,year)) as row_num
from worldlifeexpectancy ) as  table_row
where row_num >1

3. I delete the duplicate  by using the Delete clasue .

Delete  from   worldlifeexpectancy
where 
 row_ID IN (
select row_id
from  (
Select  row_id,
row_number () over ( Partition by concat(country,year) order by concat(country,year)) as row_num
from worldlifeexpectancy ) as  table_row
where row_num >1)

4. I figured out some status  say

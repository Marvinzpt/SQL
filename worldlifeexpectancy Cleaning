1. first I Look for any Duplicates  This example I concat it so it will be country for each year, so it will be easier to find.

Select country, year,concat(country,year),count(concat(country,year))
from worldlifeexpectancy
group by country, year,concat(country,year)
having count(concat(country,year)) ;

2. I USed a window Function to give a row number for  each row that has more than 1 duplicate and putting it on  a subquery to filter .

select *
from  (
Select  row_id,
row_number () over ( Partition by concat(country,year) order by concat(country,year)) as row_num
from worldlifeexpectancy ) as  table_row
where row_num >1

3. I delete the duplicate  by using the Delete clasue .

Delete  from   worldlifeexpectancy
where 
 row_ID IN (
select row_id
from  (
Select  row_id,
row_number () over ( Partition by concat(country,year) order by concat(country,year)) as row_num
from worldlifeexpectancy ) as  table_row
where row_num >1)

4. I figured out there where blanks on Life expectancy collumn 

Select  country,YEar ,'Life expectancy'
from  worldlifeexpectancy
where 'Life expectancy'= ' '

5. I Self Join to Populalize each blank from the Life expectancy collumn 
from each year

Select  t1.country,t1.YEar ,t1.'Life expectancy',
t2.country,t2.YEar ,t2.'Life expectancy',
t3.country,t3.YEar ,t3.'Life expectancy',
round((t2.country +3.'Life expectancy')/2,1)

from  worldlifeexpectancy t1
Join worldlifeexpectancy t2
on t1.country=t2.country
and t1.year=t2.year-1
Join worldlifeexpectancy t3
on t1.country=t3.country
and t1.year=t3.year+1
where t1.'Life expectancy'=" "

6. Updated so the blank from 'Life expectancy' could be populated

Update  worldlifeexpectancy t1
Join worldlifeexpectancy t2
on t1.country=t2.country
and t1.year=t2.year-1
Join worldlifeexpectancy t3
on t1.country=t3.country
and t1.year=t3.year+1
Set  t1.'Life expectancy'=round((t2.country +3.'Life expectancy')/2,1)
 t1.'Life expectancy'=' '
